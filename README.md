Final Project: Data Analysis with
PostgreSQL, psycopg2, and
JupyterLab

Project Overview
For the final project, you will demonstrate your ability to analyze data using
PostgreSQL, psycopg2, and JupyterLab. This project will involve using an existing
dataset, performing various operations to analyze the data, and integrating these
operations with Python. You will focus on uncovering insights and providing
recommendations or highlighting interesting findings based on the data.
Project Requirements
1. Data Analysis with SQL:
Write SQL queries to perform the following tasks:
Retrieve specific data using SELECT statements with various
conditions.
Perform JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables.
Use GROUP BY and aggregation functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT) to
analyze data.
Implement subqueries and nested queries.

2. Python Integration with psycopg2:
Connect to the PostgreSQL database using psycopg2 in a Jupyter
notebook.
Retrieve data using SQL queries within Python.
Implement error handling for database operations.
3. Data Visualization:

Final Project: Data Analysis with PostgreSQL, psycopg2, and JupyterLab 2

Use Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create visualizations of
the data retrieved from the database.
Include at least three different types of visualizations (e.g., bar chart, line
graph, pie chart).
4. Reporting:
Document your project in a Jupyter notebook.
Provide a clear explanation of your SQL queries and Python integration.
Include your visualizations and interpret the results.
Discuss how the findings can be used to provide actionable
recommendations or highlight interesting patterns in the data.
Online Dataset Resources

includes data published on the web, but also from repositories and
individual researchers.
5. Awesome Public Datasets:
GitHub: Awesome Public Datasets
Description: A list of high-quality open datasets in a variety of domains
shared on GitHub.
Specific Goals
1. Providing Actionable Recommendations:
Identify trends or patterns that can lead to strategic decisions.
Analyze demographic data to tailor services or products to specific
groups.
Evaluate performance metrics and provide suggestions for improvement.
Determine factors that significantly affect outcomes (e.g., patient recovery
rates, game performance).
2. Highlighting Interesting Findings:
Discover correlations between different variables.
Identify outliers and investigate their causes.
Detect seasonal trends or patterns.
Find geographic patterns and their impacts on the studied phenomena.
Suggested Steps
1. Select a Dataset:
Browse the provided online dataset resources.
Choose a dataset that interests you and download it.
2. Prepare the Database:
Use pgAdmin or SQL scripts to create tables and import your selected
dataset into PostgreSQL.

3. Write SQL Queries:
Retrieve specific data from your dataset using SELECT statements with
various conditions.
Perform JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables if
applicable.
Use GROUP BY and aggregation functions to analyze data.
Implement subqueries and nested queries for more complex analysis.
4. Python Integration:
Write a Python script to connect to the PostgreSQL database using
psycopg2.
Execute the SQL queries from the Python script and fetch the results.
Handle errors during database operations.
5. Data Visualization:
Create visualizations to present the insights gained from your data
analysis.
Use Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create at least three
different types of visualizations.
6. Documentation using Jupyter Lab:
Explain your approach to data analysis.
Document the SQL queries and their results.
Include Python code snippets and visualizations.
Interpret the visualizations and provide insights on actionable
recommendations or interesting patterns.
Submission Guidelines
1. Jupyter Notebook: Submit a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) containing:
SQL queries for data analysis.
Python scripts for database operations using psycopg2.

Data visualizations.
Explanations and interpretations of your results.
2. Presentation: Prepare a presentation (10 - 15 minutes) summarizing your
project, highlighting the key aspects of your data analysis, SQL queries, and
insights gained from the data.
Evaluation Criteria
SQL Queries (30%): Complexity and correctness of SQL queries.
Python Integration (30%): Correct use of psycopg2 for database operations.
Documentation and Data Visualization (30%): Quality and variety of
visualizations, insights drawn.
Presentation (10%): Clarity, completeness, and professionalism.
This final project will give you hands-on experience with analyzing data in a
database, integrating with Python, and visualizing the results to gain insights that
can lead to actionable recommendations or highlight interesting patterns. Good
luck, and enjoy the process!
